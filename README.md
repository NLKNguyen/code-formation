# üí° Overview and thoughts

This is an experimental stage of a context-free code generator that automates a set of common programming/writing tasks by using a template meta-programming language which can be embedded directly in your code (typically as source comments or out-of-source text files). 

The motivation behind this is to solve 5 categories of problems that I found myself often getting into in software engineering, and it stretches beyond the use cases of code writing.

This introduces a language called CFL (Code-Formation Language) that is used for configuring the text generation pipeline right in your codebase as a means for meta-programming. User custom code snippets can be written in Node.js or [EJS](https://ejs.co/) template engine to program dynamic code generation for high reusability. This language should be embeddable safely in your code as comments without affecting anything, and there are options to further prevent it from being confused with your own code syntax while parsing.

If you have used a template engine to render code for whatever reason, this tool will speak to you. At a minimum, this can be a code scaffolding tool. To a larger extent, it is intended to be generalized enough to suit your typical code generation needs so that you don't need to write yet another one-off tool.

Eventually, it can interpolate with external tools easily as one of the main goals because there are many great string processing CLI tools out there (sed, awk, jq, miller, random transpilers/formatters, etc.), and that will be the easiest way to extend this tool's capabilities while taking advantage of the developers' existing skills and assets.

Once CFL has enough features, likely Turing complete, higher levels of meta-programming will be possible, and there are foreseeable use cases for that, but we will assess whether it's worth exploiting due to the trade-off of mental gymnastic required to do meta-meta-programming.

You can start using this tool today, just be aware that it can be unstable at the early stage.
# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Required Node.js in your system in order to execute these commands in a terminal.

### Option 1: Install the most recent published version from NPM

```sh 
npm install -g code-formation
```

```sh 
code-formation --help
```

### Option 2: Use directly the latest code from GitHub

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation

```

then go into the cloned directory to install dependencies

```sh
cd code-formation
npm install
```

and use it.

```sh
node index.js --help
```

If you want to install this globally, you can do so as well from the same directory:

```sh
npm link

# check:
# npm ls -g code-formation

# to unlink
# npm unlink
```


Now you can use it anywhere in your terminal:

```sh 
code-formation --help
```

If you want to uninstall:

```sh
npm rm -g code-formation
```

# üìù Command Line Interface Usage

**code-formation** --scan *[file glob patterns]* --outdir *[base path for output files]*


`--scan`: required list of file glob patterns separated by semicolon ";". It's possible to specify ignore and inverse ignore patterns just like .gitignore syntax.

`--outdir`: optional base output path for the output files, if any; some use cases only affect the input files and don't generate output files.

# Syntax Highlighting in Visual Studio Code

Since this is not language specific nor file extension specific, in order to have global syntax highlighting for code-formation markers, you can install this
[Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-highlight) extension and copy the highlight config in [.vscode/settings.json](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) to your VS Code user settings or workspace settings.

Example

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4667129/199942822-c70ee9c7-6868-41ee-89a3-506def2a6554.png)


# How To Use

This tool scan text files line by line to detect the instruction markers. The instruction can be anywhere on the line, and the content body (for certain instructions) is the lines between the open and close markers for that instruction. 

## Instruction References

Use cases:

* write blocks of text to a file (see Blob section)
    - order can be specified
    - the whole output file will be overwritten
* write blocks of text to a segment in a file (see Anchor section)
    - the target file needs an anchor marker to denote the segment for writing; the rest of the file remains the same
    - anchor name must be specified
    - order can be specified
    - only the segment of the file will be overwritten
* define snippet to be injected into the output (see Snippet section)
* insert file content
* insert current date time


> üí° Code Formation has 2 core functions: blob and snippet. 
>
> Each accepts various commands and parameters in a LISP-like syntax called S-Expression; in basic usage, it just looks like adhoc key value pairs; in advance usage, you can write more featureful, reusable macros. 


### Blob

Blob is a block of text to be written out to a file. The open marker `!<:` and close marker `!>` must be on different lines. 

```
!<:WRITE (FILE "destination.txt")
content body
!>
```

The close marker is optional if your intention is to include all the lines from the open marker to the end of file. Between the exclamation mark `!` and the angle bracket you can have an optional label, e.g. `!abc<:` `!abc>`, that sometimes is necessary if you have other close marker that is not intended to pair with the open marker.

#### WRITE command

**Parameters**

`(FILE "...")`: specify the output file path. By default, it's relative to the current working directory. You can also specify alternative file paths via built-in variables: `CONTEXT_DIR` or `CURRENT_DIR`. 

+ `<%= OUT_DIR %>` evaluates to the path of the supplied `--outdir` CLI argument.. E.g. `!<:WRITE (FILE "<%= OUT_DIR %>/destination.txt")` 

+ `<%= CURRENT_DIR %>` evaluates to the path of the file where the instruction is written. E.g. `!<:WRITE (FILE "<%= CURRENT_DIR %>/destination.txt")` 

`LINE_PREFIX`: specify the prefix for each line. The default is `(LINE_PREFIX "")`. 

### Anchor

TODO

### Snippet

TODO

### Escape a marker sequence

To escape a marker (i.e. not getting evaluated), use back tick \` symbol right before it, e.g.

    `!<
# ‚≠ê Understand through examples

It's probably best to explain at this early stage by walking through examples that are included in [this repository](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/tree/main/examples). Below are examples of how this tool can help in 5 categories. Even though these are concrete examples derived from real-world usage of this tool, it is not limited to any referenced language or technology because the tool just deals with plain text which can be in a coding language.

<!-- ### Category 1: unify output from decentralized source files -->




#### Example 1: make SQL migration scripts from standalone DDL files

> üí° Code Formation lets you combine content from file(s) and write them into destination file(s) in the order you specify.

> üí° Snippet definitions are scanned first before Blob definitions. Snippet injections are rendered within Blobs when they are evaluated.


[`./examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/tree/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input) shows a simplified example where developers work on the DDL scripts with an IDE, but in order to make migration scripts, they must manually combine those in a specific order into a single SQL script; plus, it might need additional supporting statements around or in-between those script content.

**Problem:**

1. Error-prone and tedious by hand. Although some IDEs let you generate migration scripts from the local DB automatically, the DB support is usually very limited, and it usually rewrites your SQL code structure which makes it hard to later compare your DB server code with your original code in order to do schema diff reliably. 

2. Have to keep track of latest team convention for the supporting code around or in-between the statements. It's not uncommon for DBA teams to have policies for the object modifications, e.g.: updating a bookkeeping table of object/schema versions, switching to appropriate roles for certain actions, etc.

**Solution:**

```
code-formation --scan ./examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input/* --outdir ./examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/
```

The output file [`./examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/010_migration.sql`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/010_migration.sql) contains the result of the migration script generated in according to the rules specified in the [input scripts](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/tree/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input). 

**Explanation:**

With code-formation language (CFL), we can put the instructions directly in the SQL scripts as comments so that they don't affect the behavior of these individual scripts. This language is parsed by simply finding the markers to determine the applicable blocks and ignoring the rest.

For example, in [`BlogPost.sql`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input/BlobPost.sql) we surround the CREATE TABLE statement with `!<` and `!>` block syntax to indicate a **blob block**; within it is EJS template code, but we don't use any EJS feature in the following code (we will use it for the snippet explained later)



<details><summary>BlogPost.sql (code)</summary>

```sql
-- !<:WRITE (FILE "<%= OUT_DIR %>/010_migration.sql") (ORDER "100")

-- $!:delete_object_if_exists (table "BlogPost") (in_schema "dbo")

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost]
(
	[Id] int identity,	

	[Title] varchar(256),

	[Slug] varchar(64),

	[Content] text
);

-- $!:go

-- !>

```
</details>


On the opening marker line, we specify the `WRITE` command with `FILE` parameter that indicates the output destination of this blob's rendered result. The `ORDER` parameter specifies the order of the rendering in case of having multiple blobs outputting to the same file; it's simply a key string to be ordered by, even if it can look like a number.

**Note:** It's possible to have optional label for any block, like `!`OPTIONAL_LABEL`<`, `!`OPTIONAL_LABEL`>`, which is useful when there is other closing tag marker within the block, therefore using the tag label will ensure the intended closing tag must match the label of the opening tag.

Another thing to notice is the **snippet injection** syntax `$!:` that is followed by the name of a user-defined snippet that is elsewhere in the scanned paths. The snippets can have input variables; in this case, the `delete_object_if_exists` snippet can take the "table" and "in_schema" parameter.

```sql
-- $!:delete_object_if_exists (table "BlogPost") (in_schema "dbo")
```

The above will be rendered using the snippet template defined in `delete_object_if_exists.ejs` file. The snippets will be scanned first in the processing pipeline, so it will be available when the blob is evaluated. 

Here is a part of the **snippet definition block** that is injected above, enclosed by the block syntax `$<`, `$>`. The opening tag has the name of the snippet and optional default parameters. The snippet content is EJS template code in which the control block is enclosed by `<%` and `%>`, while the value reference is enclosed by `<%=` and `%>` (see [EJS](https://ejs.co/) for more features; also [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) is available as `_` variable reference. Users can import any Node.js library using `require` for bundled or local   packages and `requireg` for installed global packages)


<details><summary>delete_object_if_exists.ejs (code)</summary>

```
$<:delete_object_if_exists (table "") (primary_key "") (trigger "") (procedure "") (default_constraint "") (check_constraint "") (from_table "")  (in_schema "")

<% if (table) { %>
-- Check if user-defined table exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[<%= in_schema %>].[<%= table %>]', N'U') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   DROP TABLE [<%= in_schema %>].[<%= table %>];
END
<% } %>

<% if (default_constraint) { %>
-- Check if default constraint exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[<%= in_schema %>].[<%= default_constraint %>]', N'D') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
    DROP DEFAULT [<%= in_schema %>].[<%= default_constraint %>];
END
<% } %>

<% if (check_constraint) { %>
-- Check if check constraint exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[<%= in_schema %>].[<%= check_constraint %>]', N'C') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
    ALTER TABLE [<%= in_schema %>].[<%= from_table %>]
       DROP CONSTRAINT [<%= check_constraint %>];
END
<% } %>

<% if (primary_key) { %>
-- Check if primary key constraint exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[<%= in_schema %>].[<%= primary_key %>]', N'PK') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   ALTER TABLE [<%= in_schema %>].[<%= from_table %>]
      DROP CONSTRAINT [<%= primary_key %>];
END
<% } %>


<% if (procedure) { %>
-- Check if stored procedure exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[<%= in_schema %>].[<%= procedure %>]', N'P') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   DROP PROCEDURE [<%= in_schema %>].[<%= procedure %>];
END
<% } %>

<% if (trigger) { %>
-- Check if table trigger exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[<%= in_schema %>].[<%= trigger %>]', N'TR') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   DROP TRIGGER [<%= in_schema %>].[<%= trigger %>];
END
<% } %>

GO

$>
```
</details>

**Note:**  we don't need `--` prefix comment on the tag lines like in the .sql scripts because this is just a standalone text file solely for the purpose of storing reusable code snippets. Also, there is no special convention for snippet file name nor extension name such as `delete_object_if_exists.ejs`. It's just a file in the scanned paths. However, because many editors like VS Code recognize `.ejs` extension for EJS syntax highlighting, it's convenient to use it; for instance:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4667129/199942846-3ec7ae49-a701-49ae-bccc-0ba53e0b8f2d.png)

**Note:** on the snippet tag (definition or injection), you can override any of the default configurations: 
+ `(LINE_FEED "\n")` for the new line character between the lines of the output
+ `(LINE_PREFIX "")` for the prefix on every line of the output, which is useful for indentation.
+ `(CONTINUOUS_EMPTY_LINES 1)` for a post-process formatting to remove unwanted continuous empty lines above this threshold

**Note:** any parameter of a snippet are overridden by the snippet injection parameters, including the configuration above.

The result of the code we have seen so far is in the first part of the output file [010_migration.sql](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/010_migration.sql)

```sql
-- Check if user-defined table exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[BlogPost]', N'U') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   DROP TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost];
END

GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost]
(
	[Id] int identity,	

	[Title] varchar(256),

	[Slug] varchar(64),

	[Content] text
);

GO

...

```




[`CK_BlogPost_Slug.sql`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input/CK_BlogPost_Slug.sql) and [`PK_BlogPost_Id.sql`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input/PK_BlogPost_Id.sql)  have additional blobs to be rendered after the above in according to the `ORDER` parameter. 

<details><summary>CK_BlogPost_Slug.sql</summary>

```sql
-- !<:WRITE (FILE "<%= OUT_DIR %>/010_migration.sql") (ORDER "200")

-- $!:delete_object_if_exists (check_constraint "CK_BlogPost_Slug") (from_table "BlogPost") (in_schema "dbo")

-- Check constraint to disallow spaces in the Slug column
alter table [dbo].[BlogPost]
	add constraint [CK_BlogPost_Slug]
	check (
		[Slug] not like '% %'
	);

-- $!:go

-- !>
```
</details>

<details><summary>PK_BlogPost_Id.sql</summary>

```sql
-- !<:WRITE (FILE "<%= OUT_DIR %>/010_migration.sql") (ORDER "200")

-- $!:delete_object_if_exists (primary_key "PK_BlogPost_Id") (from_table "BlogPost") (in_schema "dbo")

-- Set primary key
alter table [dbo].[BlogPost]
	add constraint [PK_BlogPost_Id] 
	primary key ([Id]);

-- $!:go

-- !>
```
</details>

These 2 have the same value for `ORDER` because we didn't care about the relative order among themselves as long as they come after the blob for CREATE TABLE statement. In other words, the `ORDER` parameter value needs to be different only if you want a strict sequential order; otherwise, it just goes by the order of which blob is evaluated first.

Final result: [010_migration.sql](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/010_migration.sql)


<details><summary>010_migration.sql</summary>

```sql

-- Check if user-defined table exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[BlogPost]', N'U') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   DROP TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost];
END

GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost]
(
	[Id] int identity,	

	[Title] varchar(256),

	[Slug] varchar(64),

	[Content] text
);

GO


-- Check if check constraint exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[CK_BlogPost_Slug]', N'C') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost]
       DROP CONSTRAINT [CK_BlogPost_Slug];
END

GO

-- Check constraint to disallow spaces in the Slug column
alter table [dbo].[BlogPost]
	add constraint [CK_BlogPost_Slug]
	check (
		[Slug] not like '% %'
	);

GO


-- Check if primary key constraint exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[PK_BlogPost_Id]', N'PK') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   ALTER TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost]
      DROP CONSTRAINT [PK_BlogPost_Id];
END

GO

-- Set primary key
alter table [dbo].[BlogPost]
	add constraint [PK_BlogPost_Id] 
	primary key ([Id]);

GO

### Example 2: embed a SQL query script as a subquery in a bigger SQL script

> üí° Code Formation lets you write content into a section of a file indicated by an anchor.

**Scenario:**
- You have a SQL query that is used as a subquery of a bigger query. 
- You often update the content of the subquery and like to maintain it separately for clarity and easy testing. 
- You need the bigger query to be updated with the subquery changes without having to manually copy & paste every time
    - especially when there could be multiple queries using that subquery.

Here are 2 options that achieve the same result.

**Option 1: write the content of this file to a specific section (anchor) of another file**

The below command will bring content from `subquery_1.sql` into `main_query_1.sql` at a specific section (indicated by the anchor guard syntax `!ANCHOR_NAME<` and `!ANCHOR_NAME>`)

```
code-formation --scan ./examples/02_sql_subquery_from_separate_scripts/subquery_1.sql
```

<details><summary>subquery_1.sql</summary>

```sql
-- This code block will be written to the main_query.sql file within the anchor "subquery"
-- !<:WRITE (FILE "<%= CURRENT_DIR %>/main_query_1.sql") (ANCHOR "subquery") (LINE_PREFIX "    ")
SELECT
  CustomerID
FROM
  Sales.Customer
WHERE
  TerritoryID = 5
-- !>
```
</details>

<details><summary>main_query_1.sql (before)</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  [Name]
FROM
  Sales.Store
WHERE
  BusinessEntityID NOT IN (
    -- !subquery<
    -- !subquery>
  );
```
</details>

<details><summary>main_query_1.sql (after)</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  [Name]
FROM
  Sales.Store
WHERE
  BusinessEntityID NOT IN (
    -- !subquery<
    SELECT
      CustomerID
    FROM
      Sales.Customer
    WHERE
      TerritoryID = 5
    -- !subquery>
  );
```
</details>

**Option 2: Load into a specific section (anchor) of this file the content of another file**

The below command will bring content from `subquery_2.sql` into `main_query_2.sql` at a specific section (indicated by the anchor guard syntax `!ANCHOR_NAME<` and `!ANCHOR_NAME>`)

```
code-formation --scan ./examples/02_sql_subquery_from_separate_scripts/main_query_2.sql
```

<details><summary>subquery_2.sql</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  CustomerID
FROM
  Sales.Customer
WHERE
  TerritoryID = 5
```
</details>

<details><summary>main_query_2.sql (before)</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  [Name]
FROM
  Sales.Store
WHERE
  BusinessEntityID NOT IN (
    -- The content of subquery_2.sql will be loaded into the anchor below
    -- !subquery<:EMBED (FILE "<%= CURRENT_DIR %>/subquery_2.sql") (LINE_PREFIX "    ")
    -- !subquery>
  );
```
</details>

<details><summary>main_query_2.sql (after)</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  [Name]
FROM
  Sales.Store
WHERE
  BusinessEntityID NOT IN (
    -- The content of subquery_2.sql will be loaded into the anchor below
    -- !subquery<:EMBED (FILE "<%= CURRENT_DIR %>/subquery_2.sql") (LINE_PREFIX "    ")
    SELECT
      CustomerID
    FROM
      Sales.Customer
    WHERE
      TerritoryID = 5
    -- !subquery>
  );
```
