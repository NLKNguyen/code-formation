# üí° Overview and thoughts

This is an experimental stage of a context-free code generator that automates a set of common programming/writing tasks by using a template meta-programming language which can be embedded directly in your code (typically as source comments or out-of-source text files). 

The motivation behind this is to solve 5 categories of problems that I found myself often getting into in software engineering, and it stretches beyond the use cases of code writing. Only 1 category is  under  the focus of the current development.

This introduces a language called CFL (Code-Formation Language) that is used for configuring the text generation pipeline right in your codebase as a means for meta-programming. It sits on top of [EJS](https://ejs.co/) template engine which means you can program dynamic code generation for high reusability. This language should be embeddable safely in your code as comments without affecting anything, and there are options to further prevent it from being confused with your own code syntax while parsing.

If you have used a template engine to render code for whatever reason, this tool will speak to you. At a minimum, this can be a code scaffolding tool. To a larger extent, it is intended to be generalized enough to suit your typical code generation needs so that you don't need to write yet another one-off tool.

Eventually, it can interpolate with external tools easily as one of the main goals because there are many great string processing CLI tools out there (sed, awk, jq, miller, random transpilers/formatters, etc.), and that will be the easiest way to extend this tool's capabilities while taking advantage of the developers' existing skills and assets.

Once CFL has enough features, likely Turing complete, higher levels of meta-programming will be possible, and there are foreseeable use cases for that, but we will assess whether it's worth exploiting due to the trade-off of mental gymnastic required to do meta-meta-programming.

You can start using this tool today, just be aware that it can be unstable at the early stage.
# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Required Node.js in your system in order to execute these commands in a terminal.

### Option 1: Install recent publication globally from NPM

```sh 
npm install -g code-formation
```

```sh 
code-formation --help
```

### Option 2: Use directly the latest code from GitHub

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation

```

then go into the cloned directory to install dependencies

```sh
cd code-formation
npm install
```

and use it.

```sh
node index.js --help
```

If you want to install this globally, you can do so as well from the same directory:

```sh
npm link

# check:
# npm ls -g code-formation

# to unlink
# npm unlink
```


Now you can use it anywhere in your terminal:

```sh 
code-formation --help
```

If you want to uninstall:

```sh
npm rm -g code-formation
```

# üìù Command Line Interface Usage

**code-formation** --scan *[file glob patterns]* --outdir *[base path for output files]*


`--scan`: list of file glob patterns separated by semicolon ";". It's possible to specify ignore and inverse ignore patterns just like .gitignore syntax.

`--outdir`: base output path for the output files, if any; some use cases only affect the input files and don't generate output files.

# Syntax Highlighting in Visual Studio Code

Since this is not language specific nor file extension specific, in order to have global syntax highlighting for code-formation markers, you can install this
[Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-highlight) extension and copy the highlight config in [.vscode/settings.json](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) to your VS Code user settings or workspace settings.

# How To Use

This tool scan text files line by line to detect the instruction markers. The instruction can be anywhere on the line, and the content body (for certain instructions) is the lines between the open and close markers for that instruction. 

## Instruction References

Use cases:

* write blocks of text to a file (see Blob section)
    - order can be specified
    - the whole output file will be overwritten
* write blocks of text to a segment in a file (see Anchor section)
    - the target file needs an anchor marker to denote the segment for writing; the rest of the file remains the same
    - anchor name must be specified
    - order can be specified
    - only the segment of the file will be overwritten
* define snippet to be injected to the output (see Snippet section)
* insert static file content to a position of the output
* insert current date time to a position of the output

### Blob

Blob is a block of text to be written out to a file. The open marker `!<:` and close marker `!>` must be on different lines. 

```
!<:OUT="destination.txt"
content body
!>
```

The close marker is optional if your intention is to include all the lines from the open marker to the end of file. Between the exclamation mark `!` and the angle bracket you can have an optional label, e.g. `!abc<:` `!abc>`, that sometimes is necessary if you have other close marker that is not intended to pair with the open marker.

**Parameters**

`OUT`: specify the output file name. By default it uses relative path from the `--outdir` CLI argument. You can also specify alternative file paths via built-in variables: `CONTEXT_DIR` or `CURRENT_DIR`. 

+ `<%= CONTEXT_DIR %>` evaluates to the path of the working directory that you run `code-formation` from. E.g. `!<:OUT="<%= CONTEXT_DIR %>/destination.txt"` 

+ `<%= CURRENT_DIR %>` evaluates to the path of the file where the instruction is written. E.g. `!<:OUT="<%= CURRENT_DIR %>/destination.txt"` 

`LINE_PREFIX`: specify the prefix for each line. By default it is `LINE_PREFIX=0` which is the same prefix that appears before the open marker. For example, specifying a negative number such as `-2` means it uses less than 2 character of the aforementioned prefix. The default is `LINE_PREFIX=""`. 

### Anchor

TODO

### Snippet

TODO

### Escape a marker sequence

To escape a marker (i.e. not getting evaluated), use back tick \` symbol right before it, e.g.

    `!<

### Comment out the rest of a marker line

To comment out the remaining of a marker line, use `#` symbol. For example, having a blob insertion marker within a HTML block comment `<!-- -->` in one line, you need to exclude the closing `-->` to prevent it from  being interpreted as part of argument list for the marker.

    <!-- !<:INSERT FILE="test.txt" # anything from here to end of line is ignored  -->

# ‚≠ê Understand through examples

It's probably best to explain at this early stage by walking through examples that are included in [this repository](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/tree/main/examples). Below are examples on how this tool can help in 5 categories. Even though these are concrete examples derived from real-world usage of this tool, it is not limited to any referenced language or technology because the tool just deals with plain text, which can sometimes be of certain code language.

### Category 1: unify output from decentralized source files

Code Formation lets you define chunks of text in many files and unifies them in the destinations you choose with the order you specify.

#### Example 1: make SQL migration scripts from standalone DDL files

[`./examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/tree/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input) shows a simplified example where developers work on the DDL scripts with an IDE, but in order to make migration scripts, they must manually combine those in a specific order into a single SQL script; plus, it might need additional supporting statements around or in-between those script content.

**Problem:**
1. Error prone and tedious by hand. Although some IDEs let you generate migration scripts from the local DB automatically, the DB support is usually very limited, and it usually rewrites your SQL code structure which makes it hard to later compare your DB server code with your original code in order to do schema diff reliably. 
2. Have to keep track of latest team convention for the supporting code around or in-between the statements. It's not uncommon for DBA teams to have policies for the object modifications, e.g.: updating a bookkeeping table of object/schema versions, switching to appropriate roles for certain actions, etc.

**Solution:**

```
code-formation --scan ./examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input/* --outdir ./examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/
```

The output file [`./examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/010_migration.sql`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/010_migration.sql) contains the result of the migration script generated in according to the rules specified in the [input scripts](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/tree/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input). 

**Explanation:**

With code-formation language (CFL), we can put the instructions directly in the SQL scripts as comments so that they don't affect the behavior of these individual scripts. This language is parsed by simply finding the markers to determine the applicable blocks and ignoring the rest.

For example, in [`BlogPost.sql`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input/BlobPost.sql) we surround the CREATE TABLE statement with `!<` and `!>` block syntax to indicate a **blob block**; within it is EJS template code, but we don't use any EJS feature in the following code (we will use it for the snippet explained later)



```tsql
-- !<:OUT="010_migration.sql" ORDER="100"

-- $!:delete_object_if_exists table="BlogPost" in_schema="dbo"

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost]
(
	[Id] int identity,

	[Title] varchar(256),

	[Slug] varchar(64),

	[Content] text
);

-- $!:go

-- !>
```

On the opening tag line, we specify the `OUT` parameter for the output destination of this blob's rendered result. The `ORDER` parameter specifies the order of the rendering in case of having multiple blobs outputting to the same file; it's simply a key string to be ordered by, even if it can look like a number.

**Note:** It's possible to have optional label for any block, like `!`OPTIONAL_LABEL`<`, `!`OPTIONAL_LABEL`>`, which is useful when there is other closing tag marker within the block, therefore using the tag label will ensure the intended closing tag must match the label of the opening tag.

Another thing to notice is the **snippet injection** syntax `$!:` that is followed by the name of a snippet that is defined elsewhere. The snippets can have input variables, and in this case it can take the "table" parameter.

```sql
-- $!:delete_object_if_exists table="BlogPost" in_schema="dbo"
```

The above will be rendered using the snippet template defined in `delete_object_if_exists.ejs` file. The snippets will be scanned first in the processing pipeline, so it will be available when the blob is evaluated. 

Here is a part of the **snippet definition block** that is injected above, enclosed by the block syntax `$<`, `$>`. The opening tag has the name of the snippet and optional default parameters. The snippet content is EJS template code in which the control block is enclosed by `<%` and `%>`, while the value reference is enclosed by `<%=` and `%>` (see [EJS](https://ejs.co/) for more features; also [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) is available as `_` variable reference; in the future, users can import any Node.js library to use here)

```
$<:delete_object_if_exists table="" primary_key="" trigger="" procedure="" default_constraint="" check_constraint="" from_table="" in_schema=""

<% if (table) { %>
-- Check if user-defined table exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[<%= in_schema %>].[<%= table %>]', N'U') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   DROP TABLE [<%= in_schema %>].[<%= table %>];
END
<% } %>

<% if (default_constraint) { %>
-- Check if default constraint exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[<%= in_schema %>].[<%= default_constraint %>]', N'D') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
    DROP DEFAULT [<%= in_schema %>].[<%= default_constraint %>];
END
<% } %>

...other stuff, see delete_object_if_exists.ejs

$>
```

**Note:**  we don't need `--` prefix comment on the tag lines like in the .sql scripts because this is just a standalone text file solely for the purpose of storing reusable code snippets. Also, there is no special convention for snippet file name nor extension name such as `delete_object_if_exists.ejs`. It's just a file in the scanned paths. However, because many editors like VS Code recognize `.ejs` extension for EJS syntax highlighting, it's convenient to use it; for instance:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4667129/188786662-71309ed1-3a44-44d0-9860-4fd98a2bfb61.png)

**Note:** on the snippet tag (definition or injection), you can override any of the default configurations: 
+ `LINE_FEED="\n"` for the new line character between the lines of the output
+ `LINE_PREFIX=""` for the prefix on every line of the output, which is useful for indentation.
+ `CONTINUOUS_EMPTY_LINES=1` for a post-process formatting to remove unwanted continuous empty lines above this threshold

**Note:** any parameter of a snippet are overridden by the snippet injection parameters, including the configuration above.

The result of the code we have seen so far is in the first part of the output file [010_migration.sql](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/010_migration.sql)

```tsql
-- Check if user-defined table exists in order to drop
IF (OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[BlogPost]', N'U') IS NOT NULL)
BEGIN
   DROP TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost];
END

GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[BlogPost]
(
	[Id] int identity,

	[Title] varchar(256),

	[Slug] varchar(64),

	[Content] text
);

GO

...other stuff, see 010_migration.sql
```

[`CK_BlogPost_Slug.sql`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input/CK_BlogPost_Slug.sql) and [`PK_BlogPost_Id.sql`](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/input/PK_BlogPost_Id.sql)  have additional blobs to be rendered after the above in according to the `ORDER` parameter. These 2 have the same value for `ORDER` because we didn't care about the relative order among themselves as long as they come after the blob for CREATE TABLE statement. In other words, the `ORDER` parameter value needs to be different only if you want a strict sequential order; otherwise, it just goes by the order of which blob is evaluated first.

Final result: [010_migration.sql](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/code-formation/blob/main/examples/01_sql_migration_from_scripts/output/010_migration.sql)
