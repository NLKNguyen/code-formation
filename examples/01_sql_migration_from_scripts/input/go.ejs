For code-formation template engine.

Below is a template definition for a snippet named "go" that simply writes the
GO statement which is often needed between multiple SQL transactions.

The reason this comes in handy is because we don't want to write GO raw in
individual scripts as the IDE doesn't like that in the context of the DB design.
So, only when we render a migration script that combines multiple statements,
then this GO statement needs to be injected at the intended places.

$<:go
GO
